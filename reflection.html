        The term responsive design of a web design defined the inter-compatibility of a website through different devices. In simple words we create the web pages that fit all devices. Previously, websites were only meant for computer screens. Now the times have
        changed. We can access internet on our smartphones, tablets, computer screens and even Televisions. To satisfy everyone’s needs, the term responsive design came out. According to this method, a single code should work for all the screens sizes
        and types. The website developed itself would get adjusted according to the screen on which it is being displayed. For an instance, if we display a website that does not follow RWD, if we open that website in a mobile phone, it will only get displayed
        in the computer screen format, so we have to zoom in to use that particular website. In case of an ideal web design that follows RWD will adjust its contents such as headings, navigation bar, photos, videos according to the size of mobile screen.
        This is where we can truly understand the reason why this approach has been named “Responsive Web Design” because the website that we design itself becomes responsive towards the screen on which it is being displayed and acts accordingly by setting
        itself into the grid of that screen. <br> This course gave me so much to learn about the websites that in our daily lives. How are they built from scratch and what it takes to build a website that truly stands out. We have to follow different
        steps before even starting to code our site. According to me there are three main components of front-end web design: skeleton, skin(looks) and functionality (muscles). Skeleton means the core structure of a website. This is provided by using
        hypertext markup language (HTML). We are currently using HTML5. The second is the skin or the looks of the website. The looks are provided by cascading style sheets or CSS. And the last is the functionality. Functionality is provided by JavaScript.
        In this course we learned about all three of them in detail and practiced them in each assignment. I used to study about HTML in 9th standard of my school. That gave me the spirit to learn more about it and become a web developer one day. This
        eagerness to learn drove me to learn more about the subject and thus I learned about CSS and Bootstrap. But every time I tried to begin learning JavaScript, I found it very difficult. Maybe the reason that I was not familiar with the concept of
        Object-Oriented programming back then, but this course helped me in getting a clear understanding of the concepts which was the reason I was perform well from the start. Professor Tanvir Alam’s lectures made me comfortable with the concepts and
        gave me clear understanding on how to implement functionalities in my webpages. My most favorite concept is DOM (Document Object Manipulation). According to me it is the real power that JavaScript holds. We can create objects out of html and CSS
        elements and manipulate those elements through those objects.
